Scripts for plotting variables from standard flat trees produced by running `EcalVetoAnalyzer`. The input files, output directory, and variables to be plotted are defined in a configuration file, e.g. `myplots.conf`.

In order to run the plotting script, run:

```
python plotVariables.py <myconf.conf>
```

replacing `<myconf.conf>` with your own configuration file.
